## Right Triangle Calculator

This program is used to calculate the side lengths of
right traingles.

### Usage

Type in the lengths of two sides of a right triangle. One in each of the boxes at the top. Then select if the missing side is the hypotenuse or one of the legs. You will also need to select the form that answer will be in. Choose actual for the answer to be in the form of a square root. This is helpful if the answer is a irrational number. Otherwise choose rounded for the answer to be a decimal.

### Quick Start

As long as you are in the root directory of the source code then
the following command should run the code:

    ant -f build.xml run
    
You will need to have Apache Ant installed for this to work.

This program was created in NetBeans using Swing.
